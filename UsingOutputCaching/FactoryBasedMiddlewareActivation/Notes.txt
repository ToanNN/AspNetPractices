IMiddlewareFactory activates an IMiddleware per client request, so scoped and transient services can be injected and used.

The logic:

UseMiddleware extension methods check if a middleware's registered type implements IMiddleware. 
If it does, the IMiddlewareFactory instance registered in the container is used to resolve the IMiddleware implementation 
instead of using the convention-based middleware activation logic. 
The middleware is registered as a scoped or transient service in the app's service container.
